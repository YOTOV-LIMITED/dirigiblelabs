# Dirigible Labs

Dirigible Labs is a community of open source projects that build technology based on the Eclipse Dirigible cloud development platform. It provides the infrastructure services typically required by open source projects, such as code repositories, bug tracking, project web sites/wiki.

Dirigible Labs projects are not official Eclipse Foundation projects. Dirigible Labs projects are not hosted by the Eclipse Foundation and do not have to follow the Eclipse Foundation development and intellectual property policies.

There are a number of things Dirigible Labs projects can not do since they are not official Eclipse Foundation projects, including:
* include the word Eclipse in their name,
* use the org.eclipse namespace for their bundles names, or
* participate in the annual Eclipse release trains, unless they are included in an official Eclipse project.
